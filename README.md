## My Tech Stack:
1. Next.js - for Server Side Rendering, which is faster since the UI is generated on the backend and not with each client-side action.
2. Tailwind CSS - because it maintains my familiarity with core CSS principles and language, and the built-in classes are intuitively named. (I'm not a designer, so I need something I can work quickly with.)
3. React Icons - lightweight, and they have a large selection so it's 'one-stop-shopping' for all icons.

## External Links
I've used Next.js's *Link* element for these, as per their github: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/37597 despite initially believing that this element was reserved exclusively for internal routing.
